Medien is a Java media player that can stream online videos via HTTP or play local media files. It can also play
audio files. Supported formats are MP4, FLV, MP3, AIFF, WAV, and M4A. 

When started, the user is greeted with the Medien logo:

The user can then select from the File dropdown list to either stream media from a URL source or to choose a local media file to play. Here is an example of a Family Guy episode being streamed from a local media file:

Medien is very simple and easy to use. 

To compile the program:

In a terminal, run the javac compiler on all the source files:   javac *.java

To run the program from the terminal:  java JavaMediaPlayer

***Note***
The full screen option is currently commented out because it is causing complications that I have not had time to figure out. More details are within the source code.
